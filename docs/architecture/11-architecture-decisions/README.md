3. Fill in all sections thoughtfully
4. Review with architecture team
5. Update index table
6. Commit to repository

- ADRs are immutable once accepted
- To change a decision, create a new ADR that supersedes the old one
- Update the status of the superseded ADR

### ADR Statuses
- **Proposed**: Under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision approved and implemented
- **Deprecated**: No longer relevant but kept for history
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR
