# ADR-001: Frontend Framework Selection

## Status
**Accepted** - 2025-08-16

## Context

We needed to select a modern frontend framework for building the **Agente Virtual IA** platform that would support:

- Server-side rendering (SSR) for SEO and performance
- Progressive web app (PWA) capabilities  
- Type safety for large-scale development
- Rich ecosystem and component libraries
- Multi-language support (internationalization)
- Strong developer experience and productivity

The platform requires a sophisticated UI with real-time updates, complex forms for workflow building, dashboard analytics, and responsive design across devices.

## Decision

We will use **Next.js 15 with React 19 and TypeScript** as our frontend framework.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Next.js 15.4.6**: Application framework with App Router
- **React 19.1.0**: UI library with latest features
- **TypeScript 5.x**: Type safety and developer experience  
- **Tailwind CSS 4.x**: Utility-first styling
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives
- **next-intl**: Internationalization support

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Performance**: Built-in SSR, SSG, and edge optimization
- **SEO**: Excellent search engine optimization capabilities
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, TypeScript integration, excellent tooling
- **Ecosystem**: Massive React ecosystem with components and libraries
- **Scalability**: App Router architecture supports large applications
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support reduces bugs and improves maintainability
- **PWA Support**: Service worker integration for offline capabilities
- **Edge Computing**: Vercel/Netlify edge functions for global performance

### Negative

- **Learning Curve**: App Router is relatively new with different patterns
- **Bundle Size**: React applications can have larger initial bundles
- **Complexity**: SSR/hydration can introduce complexity for dynamic content
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Some optimizations are specific to Vercel ecosystem
- **Breaking Changes**: React 19 is relatively new with potential stability issues

### Neutral

- **Build Times**: Acceptable with Turbopack but slower than some alternatives
- **Memory Usage**: Standard for React applications
- **Community**: Very active but also very fast-moving

## Alternatives Considered

### Vue.js + Nuxt.js
- **Pros**: Simpler learning curve, excellent DX, good performance
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, less TypeScript integration, fewer enterprise components

### Angular
- **Pros**: Enterprise-ready, full framework, excellent TypeScript support
- **Cons**: Steep learning curve, heavy framework, less flexibility

### SvelteKit
- **Pros**: Excellent performance, small bundle sizes, simple syntax
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, fewer enterprise components, newer framework

### Remix
- **Pros**: Excellent web fundamentals, nested routing, progressive enhancement
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, newer framework, different mental model
